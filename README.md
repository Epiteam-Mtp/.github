## 🔧 Recent Improvements

### Issue Template Enhancements

The issue templates have been significantly improved to prevent low-quality submissions:

- **Prerequisites Checkboxes**: Users must confirm they've searched existing issues and provided sufficient detail
- **Detailed Guidance**: Enhanced descriptions with specific examples of good submissions
- **Quality Warnings**: Clear notices that low-quality reports may be closed without investigation
- **Structured Fields**: Bug reports now include separate fields for expected behavior, actual behavior, and environment details
- **Disabled Blank Issues**: Prevents completely unstructured issue submissions
- **Improved Titles**: Template titles guide users to provide meaningful descriptions instead of generic placeholders

These improvements help ensure that issues contain actionable information and reduce the maintenance burden of processing incomplete reports.
